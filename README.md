### prerequisites:

    1) python 3.7 or higher
    2) PyTorch 1.7 or higher + CUDA
    3) It is recommended that the latest drivers be installed for the GPU.

***

### Algorithms that you can evaluate:

1. Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
    + Set ***federated_communication = True***
    + You can also change the activation function to have either a linear or nonlinear function approximation model.
2. Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
3. Sum-capacity optimization
4. Max-Min optimization
5. Random


## Good Luck with your simulations!!!
